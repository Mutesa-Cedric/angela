# ANGELA -- Wyli's Part: 1.5-Minute Elevator Pitch

## Your Script

Read this aloud a few times. It's ~250 words, ~1:35 at moderate pace. If running long, trim the architecture line (marked with *).

---

> Every year, two trillion dollars is laundered through the global financial system. Hong Kong -- one of the world's top three financial centers -- processes trillions in cross-border flows, making it ground zero for this fight. The analysts protecting the system? Spreadsheets. Ninety-five percent false positive rates. SARs that take hours to write.

> ANGELA is an AI-powered 3D graph intelligence platform for AML investigation. What you see isn't a dashboard -- it's a spatial intelligence environment where suspicious entities physically rise by risk, jurisdictions map to lanes, and clusters glow in real time.

> Here's what makes it agentic. An analyst types one question -- "find structuring patterns near the reporting threshold." From that single sentence, four AI agents running on AWS Bedrock take over. The Intake Agent parses the intent. The Research Agent queries the data store, finds entities with transactions just below ten thousand dollars, and ranks them by risk. The Analysis Agent generates plain-English summaries explaining why each entity is suspicious. The Reporting Agent compiles a full investigator briefing -- and if needed, drafts a complete Suspicious Activity Report automatically. The analyst typed one sentence. Four agents did the rest.

> Every risk score is decomposable -- three detectors, explicit weights, full evidence chains. A counterfactual engine autonomously removes suspicious edges and recomputes: "what would the risk be without this behavior?"

> Hong Kong files over a hundred thousand suspicious transaction reports a year. Each takes analysts hours. Our agents draft them in seconds. That's not a demo feature -- that's thousands of analyst-hours returned to actual investigation.

> *GPU-instanced 3D rendering, real-time WebSocket, typed full-stack, Docker-ready, native Bedrock integration. Built to ship.*

> ANGELA gives compliance analysts an AI investigator that sees the network, understands the patterns, and explains its reasoning.

## Beat-by-Beat Breakdown

So you know exactly what each part is doing:

| Beat | What you say | What it hits | Time |
|------|-------------|-------------|------|
| **HOOK** | $2T laundered, HK ground zero, analysts drowning | Impact, Business Value, hooks attention | ~15s |
| **SHOW** | 3D graph, entities rise by risk, clusters glow | Novelty, Presentation, Innovation | ~10s |
| **AGENTS** | One question → Intake → Research → Analysis → Reporting → briefing + SAR | AI/ML, AWS Bedrock, Business Value, Tech, Innovation | ~35s |
| **EXPLAIN** | 3 detectors, counterfactual removes edges and recomputes | Novelty, AI/ML, Business Value | ~10s |
| **VALUE** | 100K STRs in HK, hours → seconds, thousands of analyst-hours | Impact, Business Value, Entrepreneurial | ~10s |
| **TECH** | GPU instancing, WebSocket, Docker, Bedrock native | Tech & Scalability, AWS Quality | ~5s |
| **CLOSE** | AI investigator that sees, understands, explains | Memorable ending | ~5s |

**The AGENTS beat gets ~35 seconds -- that's ~40% of the pitch.** This is intentional. In an AI competition, the agentic walkthrough is the thing that separates you from every other team.

## Key Phrases to Nail

These are the lines that stick in a judge's memory. Practice saying them naturally:

- **"The analyst typed one sentence. Four agents did the rest."**
- **"What you see isn't a dashboard -- it's a spatial intelligence environment."**
- **"That's not a demo feature -- that's thousands of analyst-hours returned to actual investigation."**
- **"An AI investigator that sees the network, understands the patterns, and explains its reasoning."**

## Cheat Sheet

If you blank, glance at this:

```
OPEN:    $2T laundered / HK #3 / 95% false positives / SARs take hours
SHOW:    3D graph -- risk=height, jurisdiction=lanes -- "not a dashboard"
AGENTS:  "one sentence, four agents do the rest"
         Intake → parses intent
         Research → queries data, ranks entities
         Analysis → LLM summaries via Bedrock
         Reporting → briefing + SAR
EXPLAIN: 3 detectors, counterfactual removes edges + recomputes
VALUE:   100K STRs / hours → seconds / thousands of analyst-hours
TECH:    GPU instancing / WebSocket / Docker / Bedrock native
CLOSE:   "AI investigator that sees, understands, explains"
```

## Tips

- The 3D graph is on screen behind you. Let judges look at it. Don't rush past it.
- During the AGENTS beat, slow down slightly. Walk through each agent like you're narrating a relay race: "The Intake Agent parses the intent. The Research Agent queries..."
- The closing line should land with confidence, not speed. Pause a beat before it.
- If you're running over 1:30, drop the TECH line entirely -- it's marked with * above. The close still works without it.
